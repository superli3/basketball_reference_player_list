# basketball_reference_player_list
Author: Jeff Li

This is code to scrape list of basketball players and their URLs from basketball-reference.com. You will need to install the scrapy prior to using this package. Once you have pulled a list of players, you can paste the relevant URLs into a text file and scrape the table stats for each player using the other scrapy code I have put up.
